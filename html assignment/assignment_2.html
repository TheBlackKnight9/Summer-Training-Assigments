  <h2 align="center"><u> List of Chapters with Nested Topics </u></h2>

  <ol type="1">
    <b><li>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Arrays</b>: Arrays are the most basic and fundamental data structures where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. They allow for efficient access using indices and are commonly used to store lists of elements.</li>
            <li><b>Linked Lists</b>: A linked list is a dynamic data structure in which elements (called nodes) are connected using pointers. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.</li>
            <li><b>Stacks and Queues</b>: Stacks and queues are linear data structures that follow specific order rules. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first to be removed.</li>
            <li><b>Trees</b>: A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node and various levels of child nodes. One of the most important types is the Binary Tree.</li>
            <li><b>Graphs</b>: Graphs are advanced data structures used to represent networks consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They can be either directed or undirected and may contain cycles.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>

    <b><li>Computer Organization and Architecture</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Basic Structure of a Computer System</b>: This chapter introduces the fundamental components of a computer system, including the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, input/output (I/O) devices, and buses.</li>
            <li><b>Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)</b>: The ALU is the part of the CPU that performs arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication) and logical operations (like AND, OR, NOT).</li>
            <li><b>Instruction Set Architecture</b>: This chapter focuses on how a computer understands and executes instructions. It explains different types of instructions (data transfer, arithmetic, control flow), addressing modes (how operands are accessed), and instruction formats.</li>
            <li><b>Memory Organization</b>: This chapter explains how data and programs are stored and accessed in memory. It includes topics such as memory hierarchy (registers, cache, RAM, and secondary storage), types of memory (SRAM, DRAM).</li>
            <li><b>Input/Output Organization</b>: This chapter deals with how computers communicate with external devices. It covers I/O techniques such as programmed I/O, interrupt-driven I/O, and Direct Memory Access (DMA).</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>

    <b><li>Operating Systems (OS)</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Introduction to Operating Systems</b>: This chapter covers the basics of what an operating system is and why it is important. It explains the role of the OS as a bridge between users and hardware, managing resources like the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.</li>
            <li><b>Process Management</b>: Processes are programs in execution, and this chapter focuses on how the OS handles them. It explains the process life cycle (new, ready, running, waiting, terminated), process control blocks (PCB), and operations on processes.</li>
            <li><b>CPU Scheduling</b>: This chapter deals with how the OS decides which process gets to use the CPU next. It covers scheduling algorithms like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.</li>
            <li><b>Memory Management</b>: Memory management is about efficiently using the main memory. This chapter explains concepts such as paging, segmentation, and virtual memory. It also covers memory allocation strategies.</li>
            <li><b>Deadlocks</b>: A deadlock occurs when a set of processes are blocked because each is waiting for a resource held by another. This chapter discusses how deadlocks happen, the necessary conditions for deadlock.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>

    <b><li>Computer Networks (CN)</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Introduction to Computer Networks</b>: This chapter introduces the concept of a computer network â€” a system of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other. It explains different types of networks (LAN, MAN, WAN, PAN), network topologies.</li>
            <li><b>Physical Layer</b>: The physical layer deals with the actual transmission of raw data bits over a communication channel.</li>
            <li><b>Data Link Layer</b>: This layer is responsible for reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes. Topics in this chapter include framing, error detection and correction techniques (like CRC and Hamming code), and flow control.</li>
            <li><b>Network Layer</b>: The network layer manages the delivery of packets across multiple networks. This chapter focuses on IP addressing (IPv4/IPv6), subnetting, routing algorithms (like Dijkstraâ€™s and Bellman-Ford), and packet forwarding.</li>
            <li><b>Transport Layer</b>: The transport layer ensures reliable data transfer between two end systems. This chapter discusses connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) protocols.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>

    <b><li>Theory of Computation (TOC)</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Introduction to Automata and Formal Languages</b>: This chapter lays the foundation of TOC by explaining what computation is and how problems can be modeled mathematically. It introduces the concept of formal languages, alphabets, and strings.</li>
            <li><b>Finite Automata (FA)</b>: Finite Automata are the simplest machines used to recognize regular languages. This chapter covers Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA).</li>
            <li><b>Regular Languages and Regular Expressions</b>: This chapter explores regular languages and how they can be described using regular expressions. It explains the algebraic properties of regular expressions, and how they can be converted into finite automata and vice versa.</li>
            <li><b>Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) and Pushdown Automata (PDA)</b>: This chapter focuses on context-free languages, which are more powerful than regular languages and can describe nested structures like balanced parentheses.</li>
            <li><b>Turing Machines and Undecidability</b>: Turing Machines are the most powerful theoretical models of computation, capable of simulating any algorithm. This chapter explains their structure, working, and variations (multi-tape, non-deterministic, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
